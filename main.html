            <h1>Our company</h1>
                <p>Ukrainian Trade Links LLC is a young and ambitious Ukrainian trading company. Our main objective is
                    to establish strong trade relations between producers and customers in Ukraine and the countries of
                    European Union. We do not only buy and sell, but we get in touch with the suppliers, visit
                    production facilities and carry out technological analysis of the production. Our main aim here is
                    to focus production on specific customer needs. In this way we match supply and demand in the
                    European Union and Ukraine. We are always opened for dialog. Currently we already cooperate with
                    80 producer of solid biofuel in Ukraine, 4 mining companies and a number of processing plants of
                    Ukraine and other foreign countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Italy, Russia, etc.) Despite the fact
                    that our main office is in the capital of Ukraine – Kiev, our managers are always moving through the
                    country, looking for new business partners and ways to improve logistics aspects.
